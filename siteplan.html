        <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of the site is to allow customers to easily access their
          next best adventure by giving them ways to contact the company, find
          prices for potential rafting gear, and schedule a trip with a river
          guide.

        <h3>Target Audience Scenarios</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I need to contact the equipment store.</li>
          <li>
            I need to check their available stock to make sure they have my
            lifejacket size.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would like to learn more about the area, including popular

          <li>
            Are their weekends that I could schedule a tour guide from the

        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          To stick with a similar color as the logo, I will opt for a saturated
          river-blue as the primary color (rgb 100, 149, 237), and orange (rgb
          233,150,122) as the secondary contrast color.

        <p id="fontexample">
          The majority of the website will be written with the font "Poppins"
          from the
          <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank"
            >Google font website.</a
