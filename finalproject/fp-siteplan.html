      content="If someone asked you what the least visited country in the world is, would you guess a hidden, tropical chain of islands in the pacific? This underdeveloped group of islands hosts the worldâ€™s most unknown scuba resort and allows tourists to visit unsupervised national landmarks. My website will take you through my journey of the capital island of the Federated States of Micronesia, exploring native culture and pulling the rug back on the superstitions surrounding the Micronesian people."
