      content="If someone asked you what the least visited country in the world is, would you guess a hidden, tropical chain of islands in the pacific? This underdeveloped group of islands hosts the world’s most unknown scuba resort and allows tourists to visit unsupervised national landmarks. My website will take you through my journey of the capital island of the Federated States of Micronesia, exploring native culture and pulling the rug back on the superstitions surrounding the Micronesian people."

      <h2>Intended Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        My target audience for this website will be aspiring or professional
        travelers that are searching for their next getaway destination. There
        are many age groups that work with this demographic, but I will be
        specifically targeting an older generation that is not as familiar with
        technology by making this site as simple and readable as possible.

      <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        My color scheme here will attempt to match the vibrant and contrasting
        colors of the Micronesian islands, with the colors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="darkblue">Deep Sky Blue - #0160D6</li>
        <li class="lightblue">Surf Blue – #00AAF8</li>
        <li class="orange">Orange Red – #F13B13</li>
        <li class="green">Lawn Green – #AAB624</li>
        <li class="gray">
          Faint Gray – #F0ECE9 (This is the page background color)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <div>
      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to my text, I wanted something that matched the islands that I
        will be promoting: warm, inviting, and easy on the eyes. I have chosen
        the 'Lato' family from the Google fonts website, of which this page is
        written in.

      <h3>
        Main page
      </h3>
      <p>
        This page will be dedicated to general information, island statistics, and pictures. This main page will mostly be dedicated to piqueing the interest of potential tourists. Users can expect to see exclusive pictures and behind-the-scenes contentthat will not be on other websites.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Local Attraction Spots
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because there is not a lot of information about the Micronesian islands out there, this page will be dedicated to showcasing the best tourist locations, including the ones that are not on maps or websites. This page will include maps and directions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Cultural Highlights
      </h3>
      <p>
        For those that are traveling to meet new people and see different ways of life, this page will be all about the people of Pohnpei. Basic language will be introduced here as well as things to expect as a foreign traveler.
